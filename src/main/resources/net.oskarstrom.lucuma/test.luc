// === SELECTORS ===
// "*" select all lamps.
// "x" select a single lamp, example "1" to select lamp 1
// "x..y" select a range on lamps, example "1..6" selects lamp 1 2 3 4 5 6


// === VALUES ===
// "#xxxxxx" sets a hex code on every channel. "#ff0000" will make channel 1 on, and 2, 3 off, (its red)
// "x" sets all channels to a ubyte value (0-255). example "255" will make every channel on the fixtures on max
// "c:x" sets a single channel to a ubyte value (0-255). example "6:255" will make channel 6 on the fixtures be on 255


// === INSTRUCTIONS ===

// == wait: wX
// This will make it wait X amount of ms before continuing executing instructions
// example w100 will wait 100ms

// == assignment: selector = value
// this will assign the selectors lamps into the value instantly

// == transition: selector = value in x
// this will make the selected lamps current values fade to the target value in x milliseconds
// example:
// 1..6 = #ffffff in 100
// if the lamps were black in the state before the instruction it will take 100ms to make it go to white.

// == fading: selector = value > value > value in x
// the selector is the lamps you want to be fading and then you can fade between multiple values in 1 instruction.
// "in x" is the total time for the fade. THIS WILL NOT TAKE TIME. YOU NEED TO ADD A WAIT FOR THE FADE TO HAVE TIME TO HAPPEN
// example: 1..8 = #ff0000 > #00ff00 > #0000ff > #ff0000 in 1000
// select all lamps from 1 to 8, and then fade from red to green to blue and then back to red in 1 second


// This is the fixture setup that needs to happen before any programs.
// syntax: fixture selector set property = propertyValue
fixture 1..8 set channels = 7

// The program main is the program that runs on launch and if anything else happens
program main {
    1..8 = 7:255 // set channel 7 to 255 on lamps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    1..8 = #ff0000 > #ffff00 > #00ff00 > #00ffff > #0000ff > #ff00ff > #ff0000 in 100 // fade like a rainbow on those channels in 100ms
    w100 // wait to give the fade time to execute. All instructions that are not wait are instant.
